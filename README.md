This is a one-page application of a fake coffee store, grounded. The structure of it is built using JS react.

Feel free to look around the application. You might notice that the only thing that is public is index.html. This is because all the work done is coded in the src files, which allows developers to better organize the pages, make it more responsive in real-time and increase the reusability of the prewritten code. Free resources can be found at: https://reactjs.org

Most of the work done already includes ensuring everything is linked correctly, importing all assets and copy needed. Any needed copy will be pasted down below.

The objective of this challenge is to get used to the fuctionality of react, primarily its usage of components (similar to the idea of templates).

This will need to be executed in two different areas: the locations section and the menu section. I'll be providing some accompaning instruction on how to implement th menu section, but the final challenge will be using what you've learned to finish out the location section!

/ INSTRUCTIONS /

1. Use the following information & put it in the data.js file. One of the data entries has already been put in as an example, so use it as a guide for implementing the rest of the information. (copy can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/yGZBrGYFqRwVFn5Z1ygWHy/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=mjFQ7pXywu5NqMy2-1).

2. Next, go to Menu.jsx. We're going to start building out the code needed to implement all the drinks that were put into the data. This is where react truly shines, as we'll only need to set it up one for it to call all of the drinks that we put in.

3. Once you get it working, you can now try to execute the same method in doing the locations page!
   Keep in mind the following:
   - you'll have to create the 'LocationItem' component & add it to the index.js folder in components so it'll be executed properly!
   - make sure your importing/exporting correctly. You can look at what's already been coded in the Menu & About component for help.
